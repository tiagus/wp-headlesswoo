If WP-Cron runs important things for you, you better make sure WP-Cron always runs!

== Description ==

**What happens if WP-Cron stops working?**

WordPress would never know if a new version is out.  Themes and plugins would never know if a new version is out.  You could login to your website everyday for months, and never see any notices about updates. If you're not careful you'll soon have an out of date WordPress installation susceptible to hackers.  Scheduled posts would never get published, auto drafts never deleted... you get the picture.  Your website would crumble up and die.

Use Woocommerce?  Subscriptions?  Customers would never get billed again!  Sessions would never be deleted.  Scheduled sales would never appear.  Your website would become bloated while giving away subscriptions for one time payments.

**WP-Cron is important.  So make sure it keeps working.**

Think of this plugin as insurance, but free.  WordPress, plugins, themes, and servers are all moving parts that can be updated at anytime.  You can't guarantee any of these changes won't break your website in some way.  While it's not likely WP-Cron will stop working, if it does, you better know about it.

Every 24 hours this plugin automatically checks to see if WP-Cron is still working.  Obviously, it does not depend on WP-Cron.  Instead it sets transients that expire over time.  If an unexpected error occurs the admin will get an email.

In addition to checking if WP-Cron CAN run, this plugin logs the last time WP-Cron ran.  This is helpful if you have DISABLE_WP_CRON set to true and are using an outside source to run WP-Cron.  Or if you simply just want to know the last time WP-Cron ran.  

For your convenience The WP-Cron Status Checker is displayed on your WordPress admin dashboard.  

**What this plugin DOES NOT DO**

This plugin does not check if a job in the WP-Cron schedule fails.  It only checks that WordPress can run the WP-Cron system.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I got an error saying "Unexpected HTTP response ..." =
This is an error you need to sort out with your web host or possibly other theme/plugin authors.  I got this error on my sites before (which is why I created this plugin) and I contacted my web host to resolve the issue.  

**403 error**  
Once I had a 403 error and the issue was resolved by the web host by fixing permission issues on admin-ajax.php.


**Problem with SSLv3**
One user had an error returned from this plugin that looked like this:
stream_socket_client(): SSL operation failed with code 1. OpenSSL Error messages: error:14094410:SSL routines:ssl3_read_bytes:sslv3 alert handshake failure stream_socket_client(): Failed to enable crypto stream_socket_client(): unable to connect to ssl://www.mywebsiteurl.com:443 (Unknown error)

That person reinstalled cURL and restarted PHP to resolve the issue.
