Translating our plugin to your language
---------------------------------------
- Go here to get general information about WordPress Plugin Translation. https://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers
- We recommend using Loco Translate plugin to do your translations. https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/
- Please see the Loco Translate 'Installation' page for usage instructions.
- We have chosen not to include a .pot (template) with our plugin as it can lead to our .pot being out of date and missing strings that you require, so you can create your own .pot (template).
- It is best to save your language files to this location that Loco Translate suggests: /wp-content/languages/plugins/email-control-en_US.po
- There are some strings that get dynamically pulled into the templates from WooCommerce so you may have to translate those strings in WooCommerce.
- Translate all the strings that you want, and click Save.
- Done!

Translating custom text areas
-----------------------------
Custom fields will not appear automatically in WPML or any other translation plugin as they are created dynamically at runtime – you need to add the string manually (copy-and-paste them) and do the accompanying translation there. Then when the custom text is called, it will use your newly translated text.
